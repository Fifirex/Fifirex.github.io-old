			<description>Just like any other 1 am, I am going around GitHub trying to find some fun repos when I come across this and then, this:
HelloWorld(dot)bf -[-------&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;-.-[-&amp;gt;+++++&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;++.+++++++..+++.[---&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;-----.---[-&amp;gt;+++&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;.-[---&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;---.+++.------.--------.It was labelled &amp;ldquo;Brainfuck&amp;rdquo;. This has to be a joke, right?
Nah.
I had just discovered a programming language whose script just seems to be random keystrokes by a toddler.
Only if I could forget about this and fall asleep.
 A whole new world A quick Google search told me that the language was created as an attempt to write the smallest possible compiler for a language on the Amiga OS v2.</description>

<p>Looking for more &ldquo;Brainfuck&rdquo; material yielded this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">Wikipedia article</a>. This article was probably the best thing that happened to me this week because after the Brainfuck, I was told that <a href="http://www.lolcode.org/">LOLCODE</a> exists:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-LOLCODE" data-lang="LOLCODE">BTW this is a comment

IM OUTTA YR LOOP
KTHXBYE

<p><em>Good &lsquo;ol invisible ink</em></p>
<p>Just when I thought nothing could top &ldquo;I HAS A VAR&rdquo;, I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)">Whitesapce</a> which is written only with, well, whitespaces. All non-whitespace characters are ignored. So here is your <code>HelloWorld.ws</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-Whitespace" data-lang="Whitespace">

<p><em>The multi dimensional Brainfuck</em></p>
<p>There were some seriously &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; languages too like <a href="https://catseye.tc/article/Languages.md#befunge-93">Befunge</a> which allows the instruction pointer to roam in multiple dimensions through the code.</p>
<p>This snippet displays &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; by pushing the characters in reverse order onto the stack, then printing the characters in a loop which circulates clockwise through the instructions <code>&gt;</code>, <code>:</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>,</code>, and <code>^</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-Befunge" data-lang="Befunge"> &quot;dlroW olleH&quot;&gt;:v
              ^,_@
</code></pre><h3 id="piet">Piet</h3>
<p><em>The truly articstic code</em></p>
<p>Programs written in Piet are bitmaps. The compilation is guided by a &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; that moves around the image, from one continuous coloured region to the next. Procedures are carried through when the pointer exits a region.</p>
<p>Here is a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; program in Piet:</p>

<li>Why not?</li>

<p>I have this wierd glint in my eyes, just going through all my projects and imagining them written in Brainfuck. That&rsquo;d be a cruel world.</p>

			<description>Heya!
Finally got down to making the site. I chose the Hermit theme for obvious aesthetic reasons. The site is hosted on Hugo because all the cool kids are using it.
This site was made as a R project (yes) and the comments were enabled by utteranc. I went with utteranc because, well, its Open source. And my seniors Parth Paradkar and Mukul Mehta use it (they are extremely cool ðŸ˜Ž).</description>

<p>I will probably be writing about something cool I am doing (which is rare) or just about some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->profound thought<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that hit me (not that rare).</p>
<p>So. Yeah. Here we are.</p>
<p><em>Now what? XD</em></p>
