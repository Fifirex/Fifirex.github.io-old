      <description>Just like any other 1 am, I am going around GitHub trying to find some fun repos when I come across this and then, this:
HelloWorld(dot)bf -[-------&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;-.-[-&amp;gt;+++++&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;++.+++++++..+++.[---&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;-----.---[-&amp;gt;+++&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;.-[---&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;]&amp;gt;---.+++.------.--------.It was labelled &amp;ldquo;Brainfuck&amp;rdquo;. This has to be a joke, right?
Nah.
I had just discovered a programming language whose script just seems to be random keystrokes by a toddler.
Only if I could forget about this and fall asleep.
 A whole new world A quick Google search told me that the language was created as an attempt to write the smallest possible compiler for a language on the Amiga OS v2.</description>

      <description>Heya!
Finally got down to making the site. I chose the Hermit theme for obvious aesthetic reasons. The site is hosted on Hugo because all the cool kids are using it.
This site was made as a R project (yes) and the comments were enabled by utteranc. I went with utteranc because, well, its Open source. And my seniors Parth Paradkar and Mukul Mehta use it (they are extremely cool ðŸ˜Ž).</description>
