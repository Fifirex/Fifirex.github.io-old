      <description>Heya!
Finally got down to making the site. I chose the Hermit theme for obvious aesthetic reasons. The site is hosted on Hugo because all the cool kids are using it.
This site was made as a R project (yes) and the comments were enabled by utteranc. I went with utteranc because, well, its Open source. And my seniors Parth Paradkar and Mukul Mehta use it (they are extremely cool ðŸ˜Ž).</description>
